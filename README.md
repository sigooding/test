4. NORMAL, SECURE & MASTER USERS
The EASYKA accepts up to 500 users and provides entry via the use
of PIN codes. Each user is provided with two code memory slots,
Memory Slot 1 (Primary Code) and Memory Slot 2 (Secondary Code).
The way in which the two memory slots are programmed determines a
users access level and also determines the way in which the EASYKA
grants access in its three Modes of Operation.
There are three user levels:
Normal User
A Normal User only has a Primary Code and is only granted access
when the EASYKA is in Normal or Bypass Mode.
Secure User
A Secure User must have a Primary and Secondary Code
programmed, the two codes must not be the same. The Secure User
can gain access when the EASYKA is in any of its three Modes of
Operation. In Normal Mode the Secure User must use their Primary
Code to gain entry. In Secure Mode the Secure User must present
both their Primary and Secondary Codes in order to gain entry.
Master User
A Master User must have both Primary and Secondary Codes
programmed with the same PIN code. The Master User can gain
access during any Mode of Operation by presenting their PIN code to
the controller. (The Master User is convenient but is less secure than a
Secure User).

5. Modes of Operation
The EASYKA has 3 Modes of Operation:
1. Normal Mode
Normal Mode is the default mode
and the Mode LED is green. In
Normal Mode the door is locked
until a Primary Code is presented to the controller. Special codes such
as "Open Code" and "Auxiliary Code" are active in Normal mode. (see
par. 9 e 11).
2. Bypass Mode.
In Bypass mode the Mode LED is
orange. In Bypass Mode, access to
the premises is dependent on
whether the controller's Lock Strike Relay is programmed for Fail Safe
Operation or Fail Secure Operation.
􀂃 When the Lock Strike Relay is programmed for Fail
Secure Operation, the door is locked until the Door Bell
Button is pressed.
􀂃 When the Lock Strike Relay is programmed for Fail Safe
Operation, the door is constantly unlocked.
3. Secure Mode
In secure mode the LED is red. Only
Secure and Master Users can
access the premises during the
Secured Mode.
A Secure User must enter their Primary and Secondary Codes to gain
entry. After entering their Primary Code the Door LED will flash green
for 10 seconds, during which the Secondary Code must be entered.
A Master User only needs to present their PIN code once to gain entry.

The REX button must be located inside the premises to be secured
and is used to open the door without the use of a proximity card or PIN
code, it is usually located in a convenient location, e.g. Inside the door
or at a receptionist's desk. The function of the REX button depends on
whether the Lock Strike Relay is programmed for Fail Safe Operation
or Fail Secure Operation.
1. Fail Secure Operation: From the moment the REX button is
pressed, the door will be unlocked until the "Lock Strike Release
Time" has passed. After this time, the door will be locked even if
the REX button has not been released.
2. Fail Safe Operation: From the moment the REX button is
pressed, the door will be unlocked until the REX button is
released, plus the "Lock Strike Release Time". In this case the
"Lock Strike Relay" only begins its count down once the REX
button has been released.

8. Programming the EASYKA
Programming the EASYKA is done solely via the unit's keypad driven
Programming Menu System (see par.8.1).Certain codes and settings
are pre-programmed with Default Factory Settings. The table below
shows the names of all the EASYKA Menus, default factory codes and
settings.
The keypad accepts as default a 4-digit sequence and in the same
manner, the access code for programming functions is of 4 digits
(default 1234).
The number of digits can be increased to 5, 6 or 8 digits. This
modification is made using menu “0”, after having entered the
programming mode (see paragraph 23).
ATTENTION: this programming must be done at the time of
installation because passing from one length to another cancels
all the memory content.
When the code length is modified, the programming access code
(initially 1234) is modified as shown in the following table 

Insert the code. Mode LED will flash green.
Press the "#" key to confirm the Mode change. Mode LED will turn green.
